# SYS-6018 Quarto Homework Format

This is a repository for the quarto homework extension for [SYS-6018](mdporter.github.io/sys6018).

## Installing

This Quarto extension can be installed using the following command (on the command line):

```bash
quarto add mdporter/quarto-sys6018-hw
```

Notes:

- The command should be run in the same directory that you keep your homework. If you don't see an `_extensions` directory in the same folder where your homework is, it didn't work. 

- If you can't get the install to function correctly, try [updating Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

## What it does 

You will notice in the provided homework templates that the yaml header contains:
```text
format: sys6018hw-html
```
This provides some basic formatting for your compiled html solutions. It will give us a consistent and easy to recognize format for grading.
