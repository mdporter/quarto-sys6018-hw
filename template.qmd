```{r config, include=FALSE}
# Set global configurations and settings here
knitr::opts_chunk$set()                 # set global chunk options
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw()) # set ggplot2 theme
```

I will provide a .qmd file like this for [every homework assignment](https://mdporter.github.io/SYS6018/homework.html). Download the homework file and add your solutions to each problem in the section that looks like this:
```
::: {.callout-note title="Solution"}
Add solution here
:::

```
This will format the solution section to make it easier to grade. 


# Problem 1

## a. First question

::: {.callout-note title="Solution"}
Add solution here
:::

## b. Second question

::: {.callout-note title="Solution"}
